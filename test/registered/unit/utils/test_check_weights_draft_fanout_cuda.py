"""CUDA: the check_weights fan-out catches a REAL anomaly on a draft runner.

Companion to test/registered/unit/utils/test_check_weights_draft_fanout.py, which mocks each runner's
check_weights and runs on CPU (it tests selector routing / merge / labels, not real
detection). Detection MUST run on CUDA: WeightChecker._snapshot stores
`param.data.detach().cpu()`, and on a CPU model `.cpu()` aliases the live storage, so
a later mutation would not diverge from the snapshot and the mismatch would be
invisible. With CUDA params the snapshot is an independent CPU copy, so a mutated
draft weight is genuinely caught.

A realistic target ("tp_worker") + draft worker are each backed by a real
WeightChecker over real CUDA Parameters and driven through the real scheduler
fan-out: snapshot(all) -> mutate one private weight -> compare. The failure must be
reported and carry the role label of the runner that diverged ([draft] / [target]).
